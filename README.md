# Weigh To Go

**Weigh To Go** is a **full-stack application** that provides a **personalized food tracking and recommendation system**, designed specifically for the **Singaporean market**. It consists of:

- **Frontend**: A **React-based web application** where users can **record food intake, track nutrition, and receive tailored meal recommendations**.
- **Backend**: A **FastAPI-based backend** that **analyzes food images, provides nutritional information, and generates personalized recommendations** using **GPTâ€‘4o**.

This repository contains both the **frontend and backend as submodules**, ensuring seamless integration in a single repository.

## **Setup & Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repository with Submodules**
Since the frontend and backend are **submodules**, ensure you clone them correctly:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/your-username/weigh-to-go.git
cd weigh-to-go
```

If you already cloned it without submodules, initialize them manually:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### **2. Backend Setup (FastAPI)**
Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file with your **OpenAI API key**:

```ini
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Start the FastAPI backend:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The backend will be running at **http://127.0.0.1:8000**.

### **3. Frontend Setup (React)**
Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Start the React application:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at **http://localhost:3000**.

---

## **Usage**
- Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser to access the application.
- The frontend interacts with the backend running on **http://127.0.0.1:8000**.
- Users can **upload food images** or **manually input meals** to track intake.
- The backend will **analyze the food and provide nutritional details**.
- The system **suggests personalized meal recommendations** based on user goals and eating habits.

---

## **Updating the Submodules**
If changes are made to the frontend or backend repositories, update them:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

Then commit and push the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Updated frontend and backend submodules"
git push origin main
```

---

## **Notes**
- **Ensure the FastAPI backend is running on port 8000** before starting the frontend.
- **Material-UI** is used for frontend styling.
- The **analytics page is incomplete** due to time constraints.
- The app is designed for the **Singaporean market**, offering **localized meal tracking and recommendations**.
